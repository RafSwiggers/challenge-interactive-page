# Challenge Interactive Page
Today we learn the hardest skills of all. Social skills! It's admittedly more important than any other skills, especially when it comes to working on a project that takes more than one person.

## Goals!
We're making a webpage! To be more specific, a one-pager. The goal is to have a page with a slideshow at the top, three tabs in the middle and a few counting numbers at the bottom. 

The tabs should contain an even summary, practical information and a contact form. The numbers at the bottom can be anything at all.

One team-member, the junior, does the html and CSS. The other, more experienced, does the javascript. The two members must work together but seperately. Neither touches the other's code. 

## But how?!
Well, the junior starts with the html and CSS, being a coach and mentor to the junior. Running them through HTML and giving them all the necessary guidance to understand any decisions made.

## But Why?!
Projects are rarely made by a programmer in a vaccum. So, we learn to work in an ecosystem. A tiny one, but an ecocsystem nonetheless.
